                <p>MODERN ULTRASONIC TECHNOLOGY: GuruNanda's Sonic Toothbrush uses modern ultrasonic technology with 33,000 micro-vibrations
                    per minute for effective cleaning and gentle polishing. The high frequency vibrations help reduce plaque and aid in prevention
                    of tooth decay, while noise cancellation technology reduces the sound to under 60 dB. With a focus on white teeth and healthy gums,
                    the toothbrush is gentle on enamel and provides a safe, effective cleaning experience.
